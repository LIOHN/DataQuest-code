# DataQuest-code WON
BigData contest to extract information from a dataset.  

Given a 1000x1000 map, with various resources spread around of different values, we were asked to purchase a set amount of land where we believed the most valuable resources laid. This was a race too, and not only did we identify the area with the most valuable resources, but we also did it the fastest with the help of py numba (an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code). Witht the prep time given, the whole operation took ONE SECOND (1.24s) to complete (out of the hour exploration time given).
